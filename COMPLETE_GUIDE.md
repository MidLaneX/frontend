## ‚ùì COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q1: "I created a task but no notification was sent"

**Answer:** Check the console. You should see logs. If you don't see:
- "üìß Sending notification to assignee..."

Then the assignee field is not properly set. Make sure you:
1. SELECT someone in the assignee dropdown
2. The dropdown shows email addresses
3. The person actually has an email in the system

### Q2: "How do I know if it's working?"

**Answer:** Run the simple HTML test page (`simple-test.html`). If that sends an email, the system works. If your app doesn't send emails, the issue is with how the assignee is being set in the form.

### Q3: "Console shows notification sent but I didn't receive an email"

**Answer:** This means the notification API succeeded, but the email wasn't delivered. Check:
1. Email went to spam folder
2. SendGrid API key is configured correctly in notification service
3. SendGrid account is active and has credits
4. Email address is valid

### Q4: "I see errors in the console"

**Answer:** Share the errors! Copy the console logs and I'll help debug.

### Before Testing:

- [ ] Notification service is running on port 8084
  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 8084
  ```

- [ ] Backend is running on port 8080
  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 8080
  ```

- [ ] Dev server is running
  ```powershell
  npm run dev
  ```

### When Creating a Task:

## üìã WHAT THE CODE DOES

### When You Create a Task:

```
1. User fills form and clicks Save
   ‚Üì
2. TaskService.createTask() saves task to database
   ‚Üì
3. Backend returns created task with all data
   ‚Üì
4. Frontend checks: Does task have assignee?
   ‚Üì
5. IF assignee exists:
   ‚Üí Extract email from "Name <email@example.com>"
   ‚Üí Build notification payload
   ‚Üí POST http://localhost:8084/api/v1/notifications/send
   ‚Üí Notification service sends email via SendGrid
   ‚Üí Email delivered to assignee's inbox
```

### Email Format Sent:

```json
{
  "recipients": ["assignee@example.com"],
  "subject": "New Task Assignment: {task title}",
  "templateName": "task-assignment",
  "templateData": {
    "assigneeName": "Assignee Name",
    "assignerName": "Your Name",
    "taskTitle": "Task Title",
    "projectName": "Project Name",
    "taskDescription": "Task description...",
    "priority": "High",
    "dueDate": "October 20, 2025",
    "estimatedHours": "8",
    "status": "To Do",
    "taskUrl": "http://localhost:3000/projects/1/backlog?taskId=123"
  },
  "priority": "NORMAL"
}
```

This is the EXACT format your working backend expects (from your Postman example).

## üí° BOTTOM LINE

The notification system IS implemented and ready. The code is correct. The API works.

**If notifications don't send when you create a task in the UI:**

The issue is NOT with the notification system. The issue is that:
1. Assignee is not being set properly in the form, OR
2. Assignee value is null/undefined when the task is created

**To verify:**
1. Create a task
2. Look at console log: `‚úÖ Task created: {...}`
3. Check if `assignee` field has a value
4. If it's null ‚Üí That's why no notification is sent
5. If it has a value but no notification ‚Üí Share the console logs

**The code logic is:**
```javascript
if (createdTask.assignee) {
  // Send notification
}
```

So if assignee exists, notification WILL be sent!

## üöÄ NEXT STEP

1. Open `simple-test.html`
2. Click "Send Test Notification"
3. If you receive an email ‚Üí System works! ‚úÖ
4. If you don't receive an email ‚Üí Check SendGrid configuration

Then test in your app by creating a task with an assignee!
