# 🎉 Notification System - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Separate Email Notifications for Assignee & Reporter**

When you create a task and assign:
- ✅ **Assignee** → Gets email: `"New Task Assignment: [Task Title]"`
- ✅ **Reporter** → Gets email: `"You are the Reporter for: [Task Title]"`
- ✅ **Both sent simultaneously** in parallel using `Promise.all()`

---

## 📁 Files Updated

| File | What Was Added/Changed |
|------|----------------------|
| `src/services/NotificationService.ts` | ✅ Added `sendTaskReporterNotification()` method with unique subject |
| `src/hooks/useTaskNotifications.ts` | ✅ Added `sendReporterNotification()` function |
| `src/hooks/useTaskNotifications.ts` | ✅ Updated `sendTaskCreationNotifications()` to call both methods |
| `ASSIGNEE_REPORTER_NOTIFICATIONS.md` | ✅ NEW - Complete documentation |

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

```
1. User creates task in Backlog
   ├─ Assignee: "Alice <alice@example.com>"
   └─ Reporter: "Bob <bob@example.com>"

2. Task saved via TaskService.createTask()

3. sendTaskCreationNotifications(createdTask) called

4. Hook processes both:
   ├─ sendAssignmentNotification(task, assignee)
   │   └─ Email: "New Task Assignment: [Title]"
   │
   └─ sendReporterNotification(task, reporter)
       └─ Email: "You are the Reporter for: [Title]"

5. Both emails sent to API simultaneously

6. Result: 2 emails delivered
```
