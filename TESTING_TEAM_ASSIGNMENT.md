3. Assign a team
4. Find the request: `POST /projects/.../assignTeamToProject`
5. ‚úÖ Verify URL contains: `&userId={number}`

**Expected URL Format:**
```
/projects/123/assignTeamToProject?templateType=scrum&teamId=5&userId=5
                                                                  ^^^^^^
                                                            This should be present!
```

### Check Console Logs
You should see logs like:
```
API: Assigning team to project: {userId: 5, projectId: 123, templateType: "scrum", teamId: 5}
ProjectService: Assigning team to project: {userId: 5, projectId: 123, ...}
ProjectService: Team assignment successful!
```

### Check Auto-Refresh
1. Open AssignTeamModal
2. Open Console
3. You should see periodic logs (every 2 seconds):
   - `API: Fetching teams with URL: ...`
4. Close the modal
5. ‚úÖ Logs should stop (interval cleared)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "userId is undefined"
**Solution:** 
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem("userId")`

- Default fallback is "5"

### Issue: "Teams don't load"
**Solution:**
- Check orgId in localStorage
- Verify teamsApi.getTeams() is called
- Check Network tab for API errors

### Issue: "New teams don't appear"
**Solution:**
- Wait at least 2 seconds
- Check if auto-refresh interval is running
- Verify modal is still open
- Check Console for fetch errors

### Issue: "Assignment fails"
**Solution:**
- Check if user has permission (must be owner/admin)
- Verify teamId is valid
- Check backend API is running
- Check Network tab for error response
